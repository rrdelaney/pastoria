# Get Started

**Pastoria is a full-stack JavaScript framework for building data-driven
applications that scale.** It combines [Relay](https://relay.dev),
[Grats](https://grats.capt.dev), and a powerful type-safe router to create an
end-to-end developer experience. Think of Pastoria like a GraphQL-supercharged
Next.js that focuses on data-intensive applications with a strong requirement
for consistency.

## Creating a new project

Creating a new Pastoria project is super easy, just run the `create-pastoria`
generator like so:

```bash
> npm create pastoria <project directory>
```

The only system requirement is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
version 20.0 or above.
