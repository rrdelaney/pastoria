# create-pastoria

`create-pastoria` scaffolds a new project that is preconfigured to work with the Pastoria toolchain. It clones the starter template, pins compatible package versions, provisions the required directory structure, and runs the initial generators for schema and router artifacts.

```bash
pnpm dlx create-pastoria my-pastoria-app
```
