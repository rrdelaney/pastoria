# pastoria-runtime

`pastoria-runtime` packages the runtime utilities that connect generated Pastoria artifacts to application code. It exports helpers for constructing Relay environments, configuring GraphQL request handlers, loading persisted queries, and sharing server context between the client and server runtimes.

The runtime modules are consumed in both browser and Node.js environments. Detailed integration examples are available at [pastoria.org](https://pastoria.org).
